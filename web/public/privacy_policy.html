        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

        <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Guia Brechó</strong> ("the App")
            collects, uses, and protects your information. By using the App, you agree
            to the practices described below.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            The App may request access to certain device permissions in order to provide
            core functionality.
        </p>

        <h2>Camera Permission</h2>
        <p>
            The App uses the device camera only for the purpose of allowing users to
            capture photos or videos within the app experience. The App does not collect,
            store, transmit, or share any camera data without your direct action. Any
            images or videos you capture remain solely on your device unless you choose
            to share or upload them.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
            The App does not collect personal data unless explicitly provided by the user.
            Any information you generate through features such as photo or video capture
            is used solely to operate the intended functionality of the App.
        </p>
        <p>We do not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sell personal information</li>
            <li>Share personal information with third parties</li>
            <li>Use personal information for advertising or tracking</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
            All images or videos captured with the camera remain stored locally on your
            device unless you decide to export or share them. We implement reasonable
            security measures to protect your information; however, no digital system is
            completely secure.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            The App does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising platforms, or
            external data processors unless explicitly stated within the App.
        </p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            The App is not designed for children under 13 and does not knowingly collect
            personal information from children.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <p>
            You may revoke camera permission at any time through your device settings.
            Some features may stop functioning without this permission.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy as needed. Any updates will be reflected
            within the App or on the distribution page.
        </p>
